                    <p>The Kenya Methodist University Medical Students Association (KeMUMSA) is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering academic excellence, professional development, and community engagement among medical students at Kenya Methodist University. Our mission is to create a supportive environment that nurtures future healthcare leaders through various academic, social, and community outreach programs.

Our vision is to be the leading medical students' association in Kenya, recognized for excellence in medical education, innovative community health initiatives, and strong leadership development programs.</p>

                    <h3>What We Do</h3>

Our community outreach includes conducting health camps, awareness programs, and medical missions to serve the broader community. For professional development, we provide career guidance, mentorship programs, and networking opportunities to prepare students for their future careers. We advocate for student welfare by working to improve campus facilities and ensuring the rights of our members are protected. We promote research and innovation by encouraging medical research and embracing technological advancements in healthcare.</p>

                    <h3>Our History</h3>
                    <p>Founded in 2015, KeMUMSA has grown from a small group of dedicated students to a vibrant community of over 500 medical students. Our association has successfully organized numerous events, including annual medical conferences, community health outreach programs, and professional development workshops. Throughout the years, we have collaborated with various healthcare institutions, NGOs, and international organizations to provide our members with diverse opportunities and experiences in the medical field.</p>
